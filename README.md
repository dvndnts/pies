# Python Studies

Welcome to my collection of Python scripts! This repository contains various Python scripts I've developed for different purposes, specifically for automation tasks. 

# Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running any scripts:

    pandas
    tkinter (standard with Python)
    openpyxl (for handling .xlsx files)


# Scripts

## formatar_rodizio.py

This script processes one or two Excel files (or one with two sheets) and formats the codes according to each step of the process.



### Main functionalities:

- Select a file with Tkinter (askopenfilename).
- Read and process Excel data with Pandas.
- Support for multiple or single sheet rotations.
